# Brew-Keeper-gui

This is a re-working of the [front-end code developed by Shay Hall and David
White](https://github.com/Brew-Keeper/brew-keeper-gui) for our final project at
The Iron Yard in Durham, NC in November of 2015. Kathleen Rauh and I
developed the Brew-Keeper [back-end in
Python](https://github.com/Brew-Keeper/brew-keeper-api).

The initial goal is to implement the Angular best practices, as described in
[John Papa's Angular
styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1), and
then implement some new features.

This project is live at
[https://brewkeeper-52a9a.firebaseapp.com](https://brewkeeper-52a9a.firebaseapp.com).
