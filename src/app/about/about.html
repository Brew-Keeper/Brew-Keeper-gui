    <h3>Good Coffee</h3>
    <p>
      Making coffee in a typical coffee maker can be as simple as scooping
      pre-ground coffee into a filter, pouring water into the reservoir, and
      turning it on.
    </p>

    <h3>A Journey to Better Coffee</h3>
    <p>
      The three most important factors in creating coffee flavor are
      predetermined in most coffee makers: the temperature of the water, the
      way it is applied to the grounds, and how long it is in contact with the
      grounds. To make better coffee, you might buy specialty beans and freshly
      grind them. Even so, those beans may not produce good-tasting coffee in
      your machine. In addition, everyone has a different idea of what "better"
      coffee is. The ideal is to have complete control over your coffee-making
      process. As it turns out, this is the start of a journey...
    </p>

    <h3>Three Main Keys</h3>
    <p>Beans: (kind, grind, and amount)</p>
    <p>Water: (kind, temperature, and amount)</p>
    <p>
      Brew Method: combining water and ground coffee, then separating the
      liquid from the grounds
    </p>

    <h3>AeroPress</h3>
    <p>
      The AeroPress allows a brewer a high degree of control over their cup of
      coffee. At first, the range of possibilities can be overwhelmingâ€”not just
      the possible combinations but also remembering what produced good
      results. Starting with a bean you are unfamiliar with can be like
      starting all over again. If only there was a way to keep track of your
      coffee experimentation...
    </p>

    <h3>Enter Brew Keeper</h3>
    <p>
      Brew Keeper provides a way to create, brew, refine, share, and store
      notes on coffee recipes so you can zero in on your best brew for each
      bean. This site was designed with the AeroPress in mind, but can easily
      support other brewing equipment.
